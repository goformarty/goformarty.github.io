### Scrum events - part 3: Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint a Sprint Review meeting is held. During this meeting the Scrum Team shows which Scrum Product Backlog items they completed (according to the Definition of Done) during the sprint. This might take place in the form of a demo of the new features.

It is important to notice that Backlog items that are not completed shall not be demonstrated. Otherwise this might suggest that these items are finished as well. Instead incomplete items/remaining activities shall be taken back into the Scrum Product Backlog, re-estimated and completed in one of the following sprints.

Participants in the sprint review typically include the Scrum Product Owner, the Scrum Team and the Scrum Master. Additionally management, customers, and developers from other projects might participate as well.

### Scrum events - part 2: Sprint planning


At a sprint planning meeting, the team decides what to work on next and how they’ll do it. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

#### Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. . The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

#### Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?
Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less.
The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.


#### Sprint Goal
Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. It is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog.

### Scrum events - part 1: Sprint

The Sprint is the heart of Scrum. It is a short, consistent cycle no longer than four weeks. The goal is to have an iteration short enough to keep the team focused but long enough to deliver a meaningful increment of work. The iterations enable the team to quickly gather feedback and continue to adapt and improve over time.

During the Sprint a short daily Standup-Meeting (Daily Scrum Meeting) is held to update the status of the items and to help self-organisation of the team.

Sprints begin and end on fixed dates and changes can be made to the Sprint Backlog that would endanger the Sprint Goal. No additional work should be brought into the Sprint unless the Sprint Goal has been reached or a feature emerges of such high value it must be brought into Sprint.

### How to reduce global variables in JavaSctipt?

1) One way to reduce global variables is to use the YUI module pattern. The basic idea is to wrap all your code in a function that returns an object which contains functions that needs to be accessed outside your module and assign the return value to a single global variable.

```
var FOO = (function() {
    var my_var = 10; //shared variable available only inside your module

    function bar() { // this function not available outside your module
        alert(my_var); // this function can access my_var
    }

    return {
        a_func: function() {
            alert(my_var); // this function can access my_var
        },
        b_func: function() {
            alert(my_var); // this function can also access my_var
        }
    };

})();

```

Now to use functions in your module elsewhere, use FOO.a_func(). This way to resolve global namespace conflicts you only need to change the name of FOO.

2) We can also start with one global: myApp = {}; Everything should be in that. The only exception would be our AJAX library (there are some extreme exceptions like working with JSONP callbacks).

There should be very few properties in myApp. We'll want to hold our application properties in containers such as config or settings.

```
myApp = {
    config:{
        prop:1
    },
    settings:{
        prop:2
    },
    widgets:{
        List: function(props){},
        Item: function(props){}
    }
}

```

### When not to use global variables in JavaScript?

Global variables can work just fine as long as we are writing all the code ourself, and only for ourself.

But they can pose a problem when we want to make things modular and future-proof.

The primary reason why global variables are discouraged in JavaScript is because in Javascript all code shares a single global namespace, also JavaScript has implied global variables ie. variables which are not explicitly declared in local scope are automatically added to global namespace.

In web pages there are very often more than one script used. If they use global variables, they can conflict with each other. The less they add to the global namespace, the smaller the risk is to conflict with other scripts.

### Readme Driven Development

Writing a Readme is absolutely essential to writing good software. By writing your Readme first you give yourself some pretty significant advantages:

- you’re giving yourself a chance to think through the project without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind about how something should be organized or what should be included in the Public API;
- you’ll also find that it’s much easier to write this document at the beginning of the project when your excitement and motivation are at their highest;
- if you’re working with a team of developers and everyone else on the team has access to this information before you’ve completed the project, then they can confidently start work on other projects that will interface with your code;

### JavaScript: multiple cases in Switch statement.

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

```
switch (expression) {
  case 'A':
    console.log(‘Great job!’);
    break;
  case 'B':
    console.log(‘Pretty good!’);
    break;
  case 'C':
    console.log(‘It’s OK, but you can do better’);
    break;
  case 'D':
    console.log(‘Not good');
    break;
  default:
    console.log(‘Sorry, we don’t have your results!’);
}
```

In JavaScript to assign multiple cases in Switch statement we have to define different case without the break. A matched case will run until a break (or the end of the switch statement) is found.
```
switch (expression)
{
   case "A":
   case "B":
   case "C":
       console.log(‘Test passed!’);
       break;

   default:
       alert(‘Test failed');
}
```

### Why to use Virtual Machine?

Why would you want to run a virtual machine on your computer? Plenty of reasons:

- Web sites that don't play nice with the operating system you're running;
- You like using one OS, but need just an app or two from another running in their natural environments, a light-on-resources game, or maybe even some uber-cool Linux app;
- You want to try out some new software, but would rather not chance it mucking up the pretty decent system you've got right now;
- You're intrigued at the idea of trying out a Linux desktop, but the word "partitioning" doesn't sound like how you want to spend a Saturday afternoon;

### What's virtualisation software?

Virtualisation software allows a single host computer to create and run one or more virtual environments.

The entire operating system (the "guest") runs on another OS (the "Host"), whether in a container window, or full-screen, or in what's sometimes called a "seamless" mode, where just one application is run from the "guest".

We can host of multiple virtualised environments within a single OS instance.

Virtual machines do not require specialised, hypervisor-specific hardware. Virtualisation does, however, require more bandwidth, storage and processing capacity than a traditional server or desktop if the physical hardware is going to host multiple running virtual machines. Because VMs on a physical host can consume unequal resource quantities - one may hog the available physical storage, while another stores little - we must balance VMs with available resources.

### Why use MAMP?

MAMP has many uses and benefits. It allows you to:

- Develop and design your site locally—no need to worry about “breaking” the live site by testing out a few changes;
- Build sites you don’t want the world to see (since search engines can’t index your local site);
- Work in a faster development environment (because it doesn’t rely on an internet connection and communicating with a web server);
- Work offline (great for trips on airplanes);
- Use the local install as a partial backup of your existing site;
- Develop sites in a secure environment (again, because MAMP sites are not online, it makes it basically impossible to be hacked or have some other kind of security breach);

### What is MAMP?

**MAMP** stands for **Macintosh, Apache, MySQL and PHP**. Basically, it is a free application you can install on your Mac laptop or desktop computer that gives you access to a local Apache server.

Here is a breakdown of the four components of MAMP:

**Macintosh**: an operating system
**Apache**: an open source web server
**MySQL**: most widely available relational database in the world (all WordPress sites use MySQL databases)
**PHP**: server-side scripting language (which WordPress sites run on)

When these four components come together, they create a local web server on your computer only. That means you can build entire websites and see what they would look like online without being connected to the Internet.

### What is Agile?

Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

It works by **breaking projects down** into little bits of user functionality called **user stories**, **prioritising** them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called **iterations**.

How Agile is different from the traditional approach?

1. **Analysis, design, coding, and testing are continuous activities** - as long as there are features to build, and the means to deliver them, these activities continue for the duration of the project.
2. **Development is iterative** - that means starting with something really simple, and adding to it incrementally over time.
3. **Planning is adaptive** - when reality disagrees with their plans, it can be easier to change plans than reality.
4. **Roles blur** - people pitch in and do whatever it takes to make the project successful—regardless of title or role.
5. **Scope can vary** - by fixing time, budget, and quality, and being flexible around scope, Agile team's maintain the integrity of their plans, work within their means, and avoid the burnout, drama, and dysfunction traditionally associated with our industry.
6. **Requirements can change** - Agile believes the cost of change can be relatively flat, accepts and embraces change even late in the delivery process.

### Class body and method definitions

- The body of the class is the part that is in curly brackets { … } . This is where we define class members, such as **methods** or **constructor**.
- Class body is executed in **strict mode**.
- The **constructor** method is a special method for creating and initialising an object created with a class. There can only be **one** special method with the name "constructor" in a class.
- A constructor can use the **super** keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.

```
class Cat {
  constructor(name, colour) {
    this.name = name;
    this.colour = colour;
  }
```

### JavaScript classes

JavaScript classes (introduced in ECMAScript 2015) are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. They simply offer a much nicer, cleaner and clearer syntax for creating these objects and dealing with inheritance.

Classes (as shipped in Chrome) support prototype-based inheritance, constructors, super calls, instance and static methods.

The class syntax has two components: **class expressions** and **class declarations**.

#### 1. Class declarations:
To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class  
```
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

**NOTE:**
An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not.
```
var p = new Persone(); // ReferenceError
class Person {}
```

#### 2. Class expressions
Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body.
```
// unnamed
var Person = class {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
};
```
```
// named
var Person = class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
};
```
**NOTE:**
Class expressions also suffer from the same hoisting issues mentioned for Class declarations.
