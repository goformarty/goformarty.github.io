Letâ€™s start with explaining what MVC is.

In object-oriented programming development, **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
**Model** component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with.

The **View** component is used for all the UI logic of the application.

**Controllers** act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.
